# Elementum-like experiment

This was created during the development of *Elementum* during final project at Full Sail University, as a small spike project to scope out some mechanics for the game to work with. Ultimately none of these mechanics are in the final product but it's good to know what was thought of nearer to the beginning. This was created within a couple days in free time off-site, and isn't likely be continued anytime soon as its purpose has been fulfilled and I haven't considered picking up the internal concepts again yet.

For anyone who wants to open this project, this opens in Unity 5.1.3f1, or at least 5.1.3

You can get the final version of *Elementum* on Full Sail's game project site here: http://gameproject.fullsail.com/gpgames/index.php/2016/06/elementum/
